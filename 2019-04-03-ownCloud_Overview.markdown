## ownCloud Overview
ownCloud web interface allows you to share one or more files and folders on your computer or mobile and synchronize them with your ownCloud Server. Once the files are placed in your local shared directories, they are immediately synchronized to the Server and to other devices using the ownCloud Desktop Sync Client, Android app, or iOS app.
