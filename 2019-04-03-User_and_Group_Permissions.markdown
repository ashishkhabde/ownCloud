### User and Group Permissions

An administrator configures a storage for a user or group and assigns permission to a single user or the list of users in the group to perform activity on that storage. 
There are two predefined user accounts in ownCloud:

- **admin**: The administrator account for ownCloud.
- **default**: A standard user account that can be used to perform various operations in ownCloud. 
	- **Grant Privileges**: You can restrict these default settings to users or groups. Specific privileges are granted to users and groups for the storage devices.

***To grant user and group privileges:***
1.	Select the user or group from the list of **User list** or **Group list**.
2.	Click **Arrow** to grant permission.
	Users and groups granted permission are moved to **Available for** section, and the list is displayed.
