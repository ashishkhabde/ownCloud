### Synchronizing files with Delta Sync

The Deltasync method of synchronizing files helps to reduce the volume of data transmission of files. During Deltasync, only the updated files are synchronized and not the complete list of file set. The client only uploads or downloads the modified sections of the files which improves the data transfer rate and reduces the connectivity period.
