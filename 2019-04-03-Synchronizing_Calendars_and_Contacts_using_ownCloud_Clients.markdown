## Synchronizing Calendars and Contacts using ownCloud Clients

Calendar and contacts always need to be properly managed on devices, when calendars and contacts are different on different devices like home computer, office computer, or smartphones. ownCloud helps you to manage all your calendar entries at one place. ownCloud uses CalDAV and CardDAV to keep all the calendar and contact information updated and synchronized. CalDAV and CardDAV are open standard applications which is used to send and receive calendar and contact information from one device to other.
ownCloud allows you to access, update and synchronize calendars and contacts from other remote system. You need to use thunderbird as it is a cross platform email client and it works properly with CalDAV and CardDAV
