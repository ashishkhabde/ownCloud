### Synchronizing files with Desktop and Mobile Clients 

ownCloud helps you to synchronize the files from the ownCloud server to your local desktop and mobile. The ownCloud client displays the current connection status and keeps track of all the activities in a log file. This helps to identify if the remote files are downloaded to your local desktop. Once the files are downloaded you can update them on your local desktop and synchronize with the Server.
